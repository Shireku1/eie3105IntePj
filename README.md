Code for HKPolyu EIE3105 lab/demo/etc.

-These codes might written wrong or not the best/expected way for how it works.
Don't blame me. I only get B range in this course, bro.

-Several asm are missing and I am not decided to update:
Sem 1: Final test (I lost that folder)
Sem 2: Demo 4b (I just skipped this annoying task and didn't do it)

-Only src codes are included, as an archive for myself
If u are taking this course, pls refer to ur own notes and materials for the config, seaching around ur setting. Tho, u can still take a look on the CompleteSample, it may show sth about how I make those setting. BUT I am not responsible and will not answer you about these problems (either any other things about these code and this course)
